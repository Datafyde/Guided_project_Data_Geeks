# Problem Statement
In the dynamic hospitality industry, data-driven decision-making has become an indispensable tool for optimising operations and enhancing customer satisfaction. In this context, there is a need to analyse the dataset to unravel insights that will show patterns, trends, and factors influencing booking behaviours. This analysis is essential to discern the complexity of customer preferences, streamline operational processes and ultimately enhance overall service delivery.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset contains various aspects of hotel bookings collected over 3 years (2018 - 2020), ranging from booking details to guest demographics. Each entry contains essential information like the Average Daily Rate (ADR), number of guests, booking agency, arrival details, room assignments, and more.

# Project Objective
The project's objective was to help optimise business operations through data-driven insights by analysing the booking records and creating dashboard(s) that provide valuable insights. The dashboard should contain insightful charts, graphs, and tables to convey information effectively, thereby enabling informed decision-making on optimising operations.

## Dataset after cleaning
- Who are the people booking?
- Which of our customers are cancelling their bookings?
- Where do we have the most bookings?
- Out of the total bookings, how many were successful and **unsuccessful**?
